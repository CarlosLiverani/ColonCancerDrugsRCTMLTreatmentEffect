# ColonCancerDrugsRCTMLTreatmentEffect
In this project, we'll be examining data from an RCT, measuring the effect of a particular drug combination on colon cancer. Specifically, we'll be looking the effect of [Levamisole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levamisole) and [Fluorouracil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorouracil) on patients who have had surgery to remove their colon cancer. After surgery, the curability of the patient depends on the remaining residual cancer. In this study, it was found that this particular drug combination had a clear beneficial effect, when compared with [Chemotherapy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemotherapy).
